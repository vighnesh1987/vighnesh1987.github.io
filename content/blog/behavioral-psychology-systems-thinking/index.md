title: Behavioral Psychology and Systems Thinking - A reading list
date: "2017-11-06"

I’ve been fascinated by the duality of these fields for the past few years.

Behavioral Psychology helps one understand how humans think and the biases that affect our decisions. (eg. Why do more favorable court judgments happen after lunch?)

Systems Thinking talks about how we come together to form systems which act in ways that can seem mysterious if only analyzed by focussing on individuals that make up the system.(e.g. How does a violent mob form from pacifists?)

Blame after such disasters is usually attributed to the actors. Individuals are punished and jailed. Disasters repeat because systemic causes are left untouched.

1.

Very analytical in nature. Introduces a bunch of terminology — stocks, in-flows, out-flows, feedback loops. I studied bits and pieces of this Math in classes on Signal Processing and Network Theory and found it fascinating when applied to real world systems.
