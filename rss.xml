My past selves have subscribed to each of these arguments with deep conviction. As I questioned this conviction over the past couple of years, I unearthed some flaws. These are the flaws that I present in this essay. If, while reading this article, you feel like I’m mocking you for something you said, please know that I’m only mocking my own past self. I’ll note that I don’t intend to prove the validity of Astrology here. That remains an open question for my skeptical incursions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Astrology is completely random. There is no empirical evidence for the association of personality traits with birth signs.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think this was very obvious back when I had a very simplistic cursory understanding of Astrology. More specifically, I thought that Astrology was equivalent to sun-sign Astrology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun-sign Astrology is a lo-fi version of Astrology. Imagine, for a moment, a 3 dimensional geometric space. Imagine data points distributed in this 3 dimensional space. Data points that have specific patterns associated with them. Patterns that are very visible in this 3 dimensional space. Now let’s look at all the x coordinates of these data points and imagine these to be randomly distributed along the x axis. Would you look at this random distribution of points along the x axis and conclude that there are no patterns within these points? If you were a Machine Learning engineer trying to find patterns in this data set, would you assume defeat if your first attempt at defining a feature set returned a high error rate? Or would you consider expanding your feature set?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun-sign Astrology is a 1 dimensional collapsing of the Astrological model. The Astrological model contains Planets, Signs and Houses. Simplistically speaking, one could think of Planets, Signs and Houses as 3 dimensions of Astrology. There are 10+ Planets, 12 Signs and 12 Houses. Sun-sign astrology focuses on one Planet (i.e. Sun) and the 12 Signs and completely ignores the Houses. Using simplistic analysis, that’s like looking at 12 possibilities out of 1440. No wonder it’d then be easy to dismiss Astrology as random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Astrology is a scam.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument conflates a knowledge with the common usage of that knowledge. I consider Astrology to be a body of knowledge. For now, I choose to punt on whether this body of knowledge has value as I’m still exploring it. People who scream that “Astrology is a scam” are really claiming that “People who use Astrology are often scamsters”. The latter is a true statement, the former isn’t. These scamsters are sometimes intentional, sometimes unintentional. This happens because the body of knowledge - Astrology - makes some powerful predictive claims. Hence, it tends to attract the gullible hoping to find direction in their life. People who are scared of the future and hence want to know the future. It’s no surprise then that Astrology attracts scamsters. Supply finds its way to demand. Some scamsters are intentional where they don’t fully understand or desire to understand or believe or desire to believe in the power of the body of knowledge and leverage their incomplete knowledge and understanding to separate the gullible from their money. Some scamsters are unintentional where they believe in Astrology, believe that they understand Astrology (see Dunning-Kruger effect) and are effectively just good listeners and givers of advice and hence attract innocents willing to pay for such advice. In either case, the practitioners are scamsters. The body of knowledge isn’t. Now the body of knowledge may be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;, but I won’t be addressing that right now primarily because I don’t understand enough about it to make a strong conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What kind of fool would believe that the gravity of planets influences the life of a human at birth!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument is often accompanied with a reference to Newton’s inverse square Law of Gravity which states that the strength of gravitational force of an object on another decreases per the square of the distance between them. If applied between a planetary object, like say Jupiter, and a human, one could conclude that this force is infinitesimally small. Hence, it’s improbable that this gravitational force would have any impact on humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaw in this argument is due to the use of an equation from Newtonian Physics to make strong claims. The 20th century revised Newtonian Physics and replaced it with Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Relativity concerns Physics of movements at speeds close to the speed of light and introduced the idea of spacetime - a unified way of looking at space and time. It also established that the Gravitational Field was equivalent to spacetime and that it was a &lt;strong&gt;continuous&lt;/strong&gt; entity. Quantum Physics concerns subatomic spatial dimensions. It introduced probabilistic measurements (waveforms) in a world that usually dealt with discrete, definite measurements (particles). It proposed that every Field (including Gravitational Field) was &lt;strong&gt;discrete&lt;/strong&gt;. The major discrepancy between Relativity and Quantum Physics concerns the Gravitational Field. One claimed that it is continuous, the other claimed that it is discrete. This is the problem of Quantum Gravity. We have two main competing models of understanding Quantum Gravity - String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity. Neither are fully accepted and Quantum Gravity remains an open problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, we haven’t yet evolved the Newtonian Gravitational model to account for the advances of Relativity and Quantum Physics. How then can we use Newtonian Gravity as our basis to pooh-pooh the Astrological claim of planetary influences?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent of arguments concerning planet’s gravity, Astrological schools of thought have a couple of flavors - causative and correlative. What I presented before was a potential flaw in the “scientific” argument against the causative school. The correlative school claims that the ordering of the planets correlates to events in the world, just like the clock indicates time but doesn’t create it. Subscribing to the argument then would entail ignorance of the correlative school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The burden of proof lies on them, not us”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought twice about including this argument. I find it quite silly to be honest. To be fair, I’ll again state that I’ve used it myself in the past and I find it silly that I used it. It seems to assume an us v/s them separation. Us, the scientific community. Them, the astrologers. This argument implicitly accepts defeat but wants to maintain a haughty face. It demonstrates intellectual laziness. And as such isn’t really an &lt;em&gt;argument against Astrology&lt;/em&gt;. But really is a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of an argument against Astrology. “I don’t have anything more to say. I’m not going to believe Astrology and it’s the duty of the Astrologers to prove themselves in the court of Science before I change my belief. Till that happens, I refuse to expend time and energy in understanding Astrology”. The flaw in this argument is that it is fundamentally uncollaborative in the giant scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Astrology is geo-centric. We know for a fact that the universe doesn’t revolve around the Earth but the Earth revolves around the Sun”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is that true though? Is it true that the Earth revolves around the Sun? Is that statement complete and correct? I claim that it isn’t complete from a scientific perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth revolves around the Sun &lt;em&gt;under the Sun’s frame of reference. And the Sun revolves around the Earth in the Earth’s frame of reference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copernicus caused the shift of our understanding of the universe from being Earth-centric to being Heliocentric. Later on, physicists discovered that the Solar System itself revolves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. And that the Milky Way galaxy itself moves as the Universe continues to expand. So what does it even mean to ask the question whether the Earth moves around the Sun or the Sun moves around the Earth? Even classical Physics i.e. Newton’s Laws of Motion are stated with respect to a frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What then did Copernicus truly mean when he concluded that the Sun doesn’t revolve around the Earth but the Earth revolves around the Sun? How would we rewrite his claim while incorporating the idea of &lt;em&gt;frames of reference&lt;/em&gt; - an idea that became cemented in Physics after his time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it’d look like this-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Sun’s frame of reference, the orbits of the planets follow simpler and more beautiful mathematical equations whereas in the Earth’s frame of reference, they don’t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therein lies a fundamental assumption in the exploration of the universe via the lens of Physics. Physics loves Math. The prettier and simpler the Mathematical equation is, the likelier it is to get adopted by Physics. I believe this happens because the reptile brain or System 1 (per Kahneman’s “Thinking, Fast and Slow”) of humans is attracted to simplicity. This bias is visible in the effusive manner in which physicists describe the beauty of mathematical equations. But why should the complexity of the Universe succumb to simple Mathematical formulae? What is more important? A venture that desires to understand the Universe in its whole or a venture that favors only those formulations that can be described by pretty Mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Ego Depletion’ v/s spiritual ‘Ego’]]></title><description><![CDATA[For a while now, I have been confused about how the term Ego is used in Thinking, Fast and Slow 1 vs its usage in Buddhism/Spirituality.

I’ve had a long standing desire to resolve this confusion as a part of my belief in the inevitable confluence of the knowledge contained in Psychology, Neuroscience and Buddhism/Spirituality [2].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per Wiki on ‘Ego Depletion’, “Ego depletion refers to the idea that self-control or willpower draws upon a limited pool of mental resources that can be used up. When the energy for mental activity is low, self-control is typically impaired, which would be considered a state of ego depletion. A depleting task requiring self-control can have a hindering effect on a subsequent self-control task, even if the tasks are seemingly unrelated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I perceive a state of Ego depletion to be one when I feel fatigued or exhausted. Thus I visualized ‘Ego’ as a mental resource that would get depleted when I performed a task that I did not want to do. And replenished when I consumed glucose or slept (there might be more modes described in TFS). If you subscribe to the ‘Thinking, Fast and Slow’ world view, then optimizing your life for reduction of ‘Ego Depletion’ or ‘Ego Replenishment’ would make sense. In my mind, ‘Ego depletion’, thus had a negative connotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding of Ego as it is used in Buddhism/Spirituality is that it’s the sense of Self. It contains a database of your identity traits and a mechanism that’s designed to protect your sense of identity. It generates cravings when you are exposed to events that align favorably with your sense of identity and aversions when you experience events that align unfavorably with your sense of identity. Spiritual practices work on diminishing the Ego and reducing the strength of the reactionary tendencies based in the Ego. The end goal seems to be to act in a manner where there is no sense of Self. No Ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is alluded to in Psychedelic experimentation too as ‘Ego Death’. ‘Ego Death’ is a state supposedly experienced with hallucinogenics where one loses one’s sense of Self. I’ve read descriptions of it about how it feels like the boundaries of your body are disappearing and you flow with everything around you as if you were in a river. Back in the Spiritual land, they say you die twice — once when your Ego dies and once when your body dies. For most of us, these two events coincide. I suspect the idea of ‘seeing a flashback of your life’ before death refers to Ego death. Imagine a process where the Ego ‘trash can’ is emptied. One piece at a time. If you’re from the 90s, you’ll probably remember the visualization Windows 95 had when you clicked ‘Empty Trash Can’ and it deleted one file at a time, each disappearing in a poof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the diminishing of Ego seems to have a positive connotation in Spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There-in lied my confusion. ‘Ego depletion’ is ‘bad’ in TFS. ‘Ego reduction’ is ‘good’ in Spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This confusion is alluded to, in Wikipedia too-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “ego” in “ego depletion” is used in the “psychological” sense rather than the colloquial sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I’ve resolved this confusion now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ego depletion’ is not the depletion of the Ego itself. It’s the depleted state of mind that I feel when I have to do things I don’t want to do. How do I decide whether I don’t want to do something? I check if that thing generates an aversion in me. How do I decide that? I do a look-up in the database of my Identity traits and see if that thing is something that I’ve recorded as “not liking”. Now if this database of my Identity traits was non-existent or minimal, i.e. my Ego was diminished, then the look-up would fail and there would be no aversion. And thereby, no propensity to reach that depleted, fatigued state of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In hindsight, I think the term ‘Ego depletion’ is poorly chosen. Because adding ‘depletion’ at the end of the term makes ‘Ego’ seem like a resource. Thinking of ‘Ego’ as a resource makes me want to protect it. I don’t think that should be the goal. I wonder if Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky had a deep spiritual practice when they wrote the book. I’d wager not because if they did, they’d probably pick a different term. I’d also be curious to understand the reasoning behind why they chose this term. [3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] I used ‘Thinking, Fast and Slow’ as the representative book for Behavioral Psychology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] As a side note, I wish there was a better term to describe what I mean by Buddhism/Spirituality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3] I’ll also admit that this confusion might just be in my head and everyone else in the world knew this already&lt;/p&gt;

It made me wonder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is organized opposition to Capitalism even possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the “organized oppositions” (see Communism) have not been against Capitalism. Communist revolutions have
been sourced out of the inequalities that Capitalism is associated with. But they’ve been against the existing Capitalism-driven Democratic/Monarchic regimes.
Every single instance of such a revolution has led to more or equally authoritarian regimes that have then become another pawn
in the Capitalist system. If you think that’s because those revolutions had tactical flaws, I’d highly encourage you to read The Dictactor’s Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of China. It may have had a Communist/Socialist government at some point of time, but its actions as a national entity were within the rules of the global Capitalist system. As of today, it’s just an authoritarian umbrella sheltering capitalist organizations while continuning to engage with the rest of the Capitalist world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official birth of Capitalism is typically associated with the Dutch East Indies Company beginning to offer public stock in the 1600s. The simplest version of the core idea behind Capitalism is that profit matters above everything else. I think this idea existed even before the official birth of Capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been there since money was invented. Or since it was clear that one individual human cannot be fully self-sufficient leading to demand/supply dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “birth” of Capitalism just brought in more players into an existing system. Earlier players were the regimes that ruled. Now with the possibility of purchasing public stock, a regular fellow could become a player in this system via a corporation that was answerable to her as a stock holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don’t know if “organized opposition to Capitalism” could ever successfully happen. Any such “organized opposition” will be subsumed within the Capitalist system as another organization. Another player.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My introduction to Chakras]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve started exploring the concept of Chakras.

My current understanding is that a Chakra is a region of high nerve density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think of the nervous system as the information freeway infrastructure of your body, a Chakra would be a high traffic junction.
Every Chakra is associated with a certain group of emotions. My mom forwarded a WhatsApp message to me which presents the following mapping-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Chakra&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Trait&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Muladhara/Root&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Enthusiasm &amp;#x26; Boredom&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Swadishthana/Sacral&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Creativity &amp;#x26; Sex Drive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Manipur/Solax Plexus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Generosity, Jealousy, Joy &amp;#x26; Greed&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Anahata/Heart&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Love, Fear and Hatred&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Vishuddha/Throat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Grief &amp;#x26; Gratitude&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ajna/Third Eye&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Anger &amp;#x26; Alertness&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Sahaswara/Crown&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Bliss&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few interesting points come up from observing this mapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positioning of various emotions makes intuitive sense to me. I’ve felt grief and gratitude in the throat and fear in my heart.
It’s intriguing that emotions are grouped with their complements. Gives credence to the idea that the answer to Fear and Hatred is Love.
It’s even more intriguing that ‘Bliss’ is on its own — perhaps alludes to the idea that in a state of complete Enlightenment, you feel only Bliss.
I find it fascinating that Sex drive &amp;#x26; Creativity are grouped together. It reminds me of a couple of things. Firstly, a conversation I had with a friend I made at Burning Man. She introduced me to the idea of polyamorous monosexuality — which involves being in loving, emotionally connected relationships with many people while having an active sexual relationship with only one. Further more, the sexual relationships she maintains are with partners she is collaborating on projects. I remember this conversation vividly because it goes completely against societally accepted ideas about “keeping work and love separate”.
Secondly, it also reminds me about societal stereotype about artists having a high sex drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exploration is aligned with a belief I hold. I believe that Western medicine has messed up by treating the brain and the body as separate entities (mind-body duality). I have a few reasons for holding this belief-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a system theoretic perspective, given that the brain and the body are part of an interconnected system, it seems incorrect to address them independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ve noted the interconnections via a few experiences — exercise causing changes in emotion via changing brain chemical balance, link between physical sensations and emotions per Vipassana/Buddhist literature
I suspect the term ‘mental wellness’ shall eventually expand from ‘brain health’ to ‘health of the nervous system’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m curious to hear from those who’ve read more into this than I have. What benefit has an understanding of Chakras brought to your life so far? What practices have you inculcated in your routine on the basis of this understanding?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On boredom]]></title><description><![CDATA[I met a friend of mine after ages. He asked me a question. “In what way have you not changed since I last saw you in 2009?” My propensity to…]]></description><link>https://vighneshrege.com/on-boredom/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://vighneshrege.com/on-boredom/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jan 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I met a friend of mine after ages. He asked me a question. “In what way have you not changed since I last saw you in 2009?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My propensity to boredom. How often I get bored. How often I act out of boredom. How it spurs me to do all sorts of things. How it remains a hurdle in me fulfilling my potential because I always get bored before crossing the finish line.
It’s a part of me that I have never really liked. It’s a feeling that I always run away from. Towards a stimulating activity — eating, working out, dance, trolling. More lately, writing 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I can get fulfillment from the stimulating activity, I am bored again. Desiring something else to stimulate the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s currently the biggest hurdle I face in my growth with a direct influence on my tendencies to binge eat, to leave projects unfinished, to maintain a disciplined workout routine, have fulfilling friendships and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So an intention I set for myself recently was to conquer boredom. No longer be a slave to it. Defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got excited at that idea. I saw a grandiose vision of never being bored again in my life. As if my life would soon be a perfectly ordered sequence of stimulating activities, where the next activity starts right before the boredom kicks in with the earlier one. Or me being able to work mechanically on whatever I set my mind at without experiencing any boredom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such silly visions, both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline helped me with an EFT session the last time I was feeling a surge of boredom rising in me. It contributed in changing my perspective of how I look at boredom. Less as a foe. More acceptance and adaptation. In hindsight, this paraphrasing makes complete sense and fits in with the axiom of “acceptance as a path to change” that I fully buy into. I suppose it took a while for me to accept it as a strategy because the feelings associated with boredom trigger a past active self within me which snoozes my observer state of mind because that state did not exist at the time when this past active self was molded. I grew up in a joint Indian family which had a quintessential Indian problem of the mother-in-law not getting along with her daughter-in-law arguably because she didn’t want to share her son’s attention? But really because India in the 80s and 90s was an odd society that was firmly conservative but was gradually opening up to western ideas and some women (like my mom) had fully assimilated western notions of independence and self-reliance that clashed with existing social structures. When faced with this conflict between two women I deeply loved, I did not respond well. It was a feeling of helplessness that perhaps contributed to emotionally closing up and resorting to food as a distraction. I say this with a grain of salt because it’s really hard to actually figure out things about your past with certainty. The past is but a hazy fog in your brain which remembers selectively and can be soft programmed to even alter memories and recollections which remains an argument against hypnotherapy. I also feel hesitation at exploring this line of reasoning lest it comes across as blaming those who raised me so lovingly. Disclaimers aside, perhaps that same feeling of helplessness gets triggered when I can’t keep myself busy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m visualizing my propensity to boredom as a small part of me instead of a foe. A child that wants my attention but I always get annoyed when he expresses that desire and I neglect him. And he keeps coming back. And I keep neglecting him. I now desire to work on activating the observer state of mind when I sense boredom creeping up next.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cold exposure & non-normative behavior]]></title><description><![CDATA[As the weather gets colder, I’m beginning to get back to cold exposure training.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My progression in this domain has been as follows -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2016–17) walking in t-shirts, no jackets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2017–18) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17878850164201272/&quot;&gt;walking shirtless in NYC and hiking shirtless in Catskills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to figure out how to level this up in the upcoming winter. I started biking shirtless last week. I might end up making a trip to the Midwest (ahem Justine, Omkar) or to Toronto (ahem Tush, Ashwin) to try out shirtless walks in colder climates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get a wide variety of reactions on shirtless walks. Disapproving head shaking. Smiles. Dumbfounded stares. Chuckles that seem to say “oh this is exactly what I’d expect in NYC.” Angry motherly scoldings of the kind “put your jacket on or you’ll fall ill!”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually don’t respond to any of the reactions. Primarily because it takes me away from my focus on my breath, which is the main thing I’m really doing on cold walks. If I lose the focus on my breath, I start shivering and panicking about feeling cold. As long as I’m with my breath, everything is calm and I can go on till mental fatigue kicks in. Typically around the 3h mark during my Catskills hikes in 20F. It’s either mental fatigue or boredom that breaks this state of presentness and makes me susceptible to shivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These walks are also an experiment in non-normative behavior. They violate social norms of what people expect to see around them in the winter. The other example of my non-normative behavior that I can remember right now is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BmFzpumhWFs/?taken-by=viggiereggae&quot;&gt;subway tricks&lt;/a&gt; that I really got into while commuting from Ditmas Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societies evolve to discourage non-normative behavior. A clear, concise example of this evolution is the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://workingoutloud.com/blog/the-five-monkeys-experiment-with-a-new-lesson&quot;&gt;five monkeys and a ladder&lt;/a&gt;’ experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellence is non-normative by definition. If you’re amongst the best in any domain, you’re demonstrating non-normative behavior in that domain. If you want to be the best, it’s useful to learn how to subconsciously shirk off the feeling of ‘weirdness’ that seems to arise when you perceive that the society is judging you for non-normative behavior. While you’re working towards excellence in a field, society has a tendency to hold you back via judgment. Not intentionally. It’s just how individual human behavior evolves into systemic societal behavior. Once you’re the best in any field, societal judgment flips 180 degrees into admiration. Society lionizes you. Calls you different. Talented. Again in an attempt to reinforce normative behavior by telling the people currently in the normative zone that there was something inherently different about those who break through the normative zones into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@viggiereggae/cold-exposure-and-non-normative-behavior-6e8c40f48216&quot;&gt;fat tails&lt;/a&gt; of excellence. So that the rest don’t get ideas and continue their normative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like playing around with non-normative behavior and observe the reactions. I like to also observe my own reactions when I notice non-normative behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect instinctive, guttural negative judgment of non-normative behavior arises via two mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I imagine myself in the shoes of the non-normative actor. I then imagine the feeling of judgment I’d perceive from society. That feeling doesn’t feel good. That translates to ‘judgment’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I am with someone engaging in non-normative behavior, I am concerned about their behavior influencing societal opinion of me. I’m concerned about my distributed Ego* being hurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these mechanisms are non-beneficial for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1, because it’s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems&quot;&gt;System 1 fallacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@viggiereggae/an-elevator-pitch-for-vipassana-d7ed5f715a6c&quot;&gt;Ego death is worth pursuing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed Ego is the piece of your Ego that resides in heads of the people you interact with. It’s your perception of the image you’ve created in their minds. Imagine doing something foolish when you’re alone. Now imagine doing the same thing when there are people around who you know and perhaps want to impress. The second situation is harder to deal with because your distributed Ego is active there. More &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Al6avEKEpJ0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

I’m presenting an engineer’s outlook on how these two concepts work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;Identity is a database of traits that define you&lt;/strong&gt;. You can think of these traits as membership cards to human communities. Membership is obtained via your likes/dislikes or your context.
For eg. if you really love Apple, you gain membership to the Apple fanboy community. If you truly dislike Trump, you gain membership to the anti-Trump community. If you are a brown immigrant in America, you gain membership to that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an event happens, the Ego processing unit in your brain does a look-up on the Identity database and tries to answer the question “&lt;strong&gt;Do I like/dislike this event?&lt;/strong&gt;”.
For eg. Event ‘iPhone launch got delayed’ will return a ‘dislike’ from an Identity which includes the trait ‘Apply fanboy’. Event ‘Hasan Minhaj released a Netflix special’ may return a ‘like’ from an Identity which includes the trait ‘brown American immigrant’. Event ‘Trump got elected’ will return a ‘dislike’ from an Identity which includes the trait ‘anti-Trumper’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer is a ‘like’, then your Ego generates a Craving for more of the event. This &lt;strong&gt;Craving becomes a source of Misery when the event ends&lt;/strong&gt; as it does because everything is impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer is a ‘dislike’, then your Ego generates an Aversion. This &lt;strong&gt;Aversion becomes a source of Misery while the event persists&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a society where Identities are susceptible to fattening. There are many systemic forces acting in their own self-interests to fatten individual Identities.
For eg. Apple benefits monetarily from having more Apple fanboys. Nations benefit from inculcating national Identities in their citizens because such citizens are less likely to protest (eg. exhortations of the kind “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country”). The brown immigrant community can benefit by having more members in it. Some of these systemic benefits may be aligned with your individual interests. Some might not be. The key point here is in being conscious about what is a part of your Identity and how it got in there in the first place. Paul Graham’s goes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html&quot;&gt;into this in detail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one way of reducing misery is being conscious about the size of your Identity database. You can reverse engineer this mechanism to enable an Identity reduction. Keep track of occasions of extreme happiness and extreme sorrow. These occasions will typically point out to some trait in your Identity database. Ask yourself how this community membership got into your Identity database in the first place and what value it adds to your life. Note here that it’s important to track both happiness and sorrow for faster Identity reduction. This is because both emotions can point to the same Identity trait. The Egotic trap is to maintain your community membership via positive emotions and then slam you with the negative ones. Any attempt at just ‘fixing’ the negatives will be futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cravings generate from Likes out of a desire for permanence and Aversions generate from Dislikes out of a concern about their permanence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A desire for permanence is foolish because everything is impermanent. Literally everything. However, just logically accepting this isn’t enough because once the Craving/Aversion has been generated, it’s already led to Misery and you’re now fighting an uphill battle. This has to be accepted subconsciously. Subconscious acceptance of Impermanence of everything throws a spanner into Egotic machinery and is the permanent way to fix Misery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misery is bad and should be fixed. Misery makes you less efficient in action. Misery wastes time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;physical&lt;/em&gt; exercise for doing this is what the Buddha discovered and was his main innovation and contribution to human society. It’s called Vipassana and I’ve pitched it before in an earlier post.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Love v/s Fear]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve been observing the dichotomy of these two emotions every time I’m faced with hard binary decisions.

The idea of this dichotomy is based on the book ‘A Return to Love’ whose premise is that one should act on love, not fear. I’m yet to read the book but the idea has been playing on my mind ever since Rebecca recommended it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by this idea because it presents what seems like the easiest decision making model. And I wonder if it’s optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been experimenting with it in the recent past and have observed some patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with a hard decision, the initial emotion that gets evoked in me is fear. Fear of judgement when I consider following my urge to hang upside down on the subway bars. Fear of rejection when I’m trying to decide if I should approach a woman I’m attracted to. You get the drift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I don’t act on the fear, it subsides over time. The rate at which it subsides depends upon how much I crave a specific end result, how much I’ve meditated in the recent past and how much the event has triggered a ‘past active role’ (to borrow terminology from SCT — more on SCT later, but hat tip to Swati for introducing me to it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I choose not to act on fear, it subsides. Once it subsides and I think about the same scenario again, I notice love (or compassion) emerge and a possible action materialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then use a couple of tests to vet the action against my people pleasing nature and to test the level of Truth in the action. The idea of these tests is to ensure that I’m not acting to please and that I’m acting because the action resonates with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the former, I try to observe whether I want a specific response from the person. Eg. telling someone I care about them because I think they’ll like hearing it or putting up a post because I want the likes ;) If I find myself being equanimous to the response, then the action has passed the first test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the latter, I try to observe if it aligns with my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@viggiereggae/an-attempt-at-defining-axioms-for-life-12f9cccc3162&quot;&gt;axioms&lt;/a&gt;. This is trickier because I wonder how much of it is just pure intellectual rationalization and because the axioms themselves are evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have liked this decision model for how fast it is to execute. I’m not sure how to evaluate its optimality. I do think that love has a compounding behavior. It creates positive feedback loops in all the systems it seeps into. It reminds me of a quote from Naval Ravikant -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the benefits in life come from compound interest — money, relationships, habits — anything of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Jan 2019&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on top of this framework, I realized a distinct difference between these two modes of taking actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis is that actions can be classified as being sourced from a place of Love or a place of Fear. The recommended steps in this framework are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice the intention to act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gauge whether the action you are feeling inclined to perform is from a place of Love or Fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act, if it is from a place of Love. Don’t act otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I realized today is that these two modes differ in how they focus attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I act out of Love, my attention is focussed outwards. I feel stable. Secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I act out of Fear, my attention is focussed inwards. My fight or flight response is activated. I feel defensive. I have the urge to protect myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This difference in where my attention is focussed causes a huge difference in my ability to listen. Listen to words. To body language cues. To the emotion that is being sub-communicated. And respond to that instead of acting on my inner fight or flight response. The ability to listen is the main determining factor of utility of conversations — so the implication here is that acting on Love is optimal for better conversations and thereby better relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This observation applies to scenarios where I’m conversing with someone. In such conversations, when I’ve noticed my desire to say something out of Fear, I’ve chosen not to and instead gone silent. This has led to some odd silences which would leave my conversation partner confused as I wait for the Fear to subside. I’ve since found a better strategy to account for this silence. I note the Fear. Say it out loud. And seen it dissipate. When I started noting Fear out loud, I’d find myself wrapping it up in disclaimers — “I don’t like this aspect of my personality but…”, “I’m noticing this Fear and I’m not happy with it but…”. Now I realize that these disclaimers themselves are an act of Fear. They are sourced from the Fear of being judged. More pragmatically, they are also time inefficient. Stating the Fear fully is the best way to disarm it and bring yourself back to Love. Accepting my Fears fully is a way of showing myself Love.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Preliminary musings on Consciousness]]></title><description><![CDATA[Consciousness is often correlated with the ability to feel pain.

This latter measure seems to be at the heart of typical scales of consciousness diagrams that plot all living beings from the least conscious (single cellular organisms? non-living things?) to the most conscious (humans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t find a good representative image but typically the boundaries that such a scale goes through are non-living vs living, single cellular vs multi cellular, trees vs animals, invertebrates vs vertebrates, non-mammals vs mammals, mammals vs humans, in order of increasing consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability to feel pain seems to assume a human centric view of expression of pain. The scale could as well be labelled ‘beings arranged in order of increasing similarities to humans’. Hence, vertebrates are assumed to be more conscious than invertebrates. Mammals more conscious than fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can almost sense traces of human Egotism in how this scale is laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the word ‘consciousness’ came into being around 1500 — overlapping with the Renaissance. A critical aspect of the Renaissance was the emergence of humanism. Art moved away from depicting Gods to depicting humans. This coupled with a crazy pace of scientific and technological since then has contributed to the collective human Ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering how much this historical context of the resurgence of collective human Ego has fed into some innate assumptions we’ve made about Consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is a bit funny if you think of the Ego and Consciousness as foes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is closely associated with awareness. One could say that self-awareness is rooted in consciousness. Spiritual practices encourage tapping into self-awareness to observe Egotic reactions so as to overcome them over time to attain Enlightenment. In that sense, Consciousness and the Ego are foes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder then if Enlightenment is a hyped up term to describe something that’s stupidly simple once you achieve it. If you ask people around you whether Enlightenment is attainable, I’m willing to bet that the typical response you’d get is a strong no. But the way we, humans, evaluate possibility of accomplishing a task is flawed. We evaluate it by looking at a heuristic — number of people that we’ve heard of who have accomplished it. In the case of Enlightenment, that typically gives us a single digit number across the multiple billions of humans that have existed. So it seems improbable. It’s tricky to evaluate the existence of Enlightenment though — because it’s not a very visible trait. What if Enlightenment was actually all around us, and because adult humans are so far away from it, that it’s omnipresence remains blind to us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on the Consciousness vs Ego idea, what if the scale of increasing Consciousness is also the scale of increasing Ego and the scale of decreasing Enlightenment. This fits in with some simple observations eg. dogs and babies are considered to be ‘more present’ than humans. Enlightenment is also synonymous with a state of Presentness. Perhaps lack of expression of pain is also a trait of an Enlightened state of being — because perhaps when you know and accept that the pain trigger is impermanent, why would you bother reacting to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that sense, then non-living things are steeped in Enlightenment — forever present, never reacting. And humans are furthest away from it. So may be, Enlightenment isn’t a big deal and is actually surrounds us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presenting some draft ideas on this thought exercise, perhaps there exists a duality of Ego and Consciousness. They both arise together as they feed into each other and they both disappear together. So at birth, your Ego and Consciousness are both born and then they increase in size and then they diminish together at death. What we consider as non-living things don’t need Consciousness because they lack Ego. This idea seems to also resonate with my preliminary understanding of the concept of psychedelic Ego Death — which can lead to a state of being where the boundaries of one’s self disappear. There’s notions of fear associated with it in the little I’ve learnt about it because it can be accompanied with a complete lack of desire to act. If there is no you, what will you act for? The absence of action could be perceived by an observer as unconsciousness. Another hint that the Ego and Consciousness die together? Are they the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My readings on consciousness are very preliminary so I’d love any insights that you could provide or thoughts that this post evoked in you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alignment]]></title><description><![CDATA[Imagine all humans plotted across a spectrum of information sources that feed into their decisions.

On the left end of the spectrum, are humans driven by internal information sources i.e. gut. On the right end are humans driven by external information sources i.e. data. The left end is susceptible to confirmation bias and an underdeveloped gut. The right end is susceptible to misery that arises from not listening to one’s gut. A colloquial way of describing this is deciding with your brain vs heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere in between lies aligned decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sets of information sources — internal and external are noisy in nature. Conflicted decision making happens due to misalignment between these sources of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can and should work on improving noise cancellation. Internal information gathering can be improved via building a stronger connection with one’s gut. As you get closer to your gut, your mental mapping of nature of external situations and emotions that they trigger improves and you are better able to predict how you’ll react. External information gathering can be aided by active listening, asking good questions, saying yes to new experiences, tracking subconscious biases. Each of these strategies seem to complement and strengthen each other. In my experience, meditation has aided stronger relationship with my gut, active listening, quality of my questions and tracking of subconscious biases. Saying yes to new experiences is born out of an innate curiosity and a desire to make optimum use of time. I don’t know where the innate curiosity comes from. I know that the desire to make optimum use of time is heightened due to a feeling of having lost my 20s to suboptimal experiences combined with a tendency to check out in anything that doesn’t capture my attention. Back from the introspective detour onto the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s this idea of universal wisdom, Truth, universal consciousness that’s commonly found in spiritual literature. For my non-spiritual friends, the hypothesis seems to be that meditation allows us to connect to the universal consciousness and act in a manner that the universe wants us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is something I wonder. Assume every statement prefixed with a ‘perhaps’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have successfully removed all noise from the internal and external sources of information, the core signal in both sources will be the same. That core signal is what is referred to as universal wisdom. That will lead to mental ease and fully aligned decisions. Phrases like ‘when the time is right, you will know it’ allude to this alignment that each of us experiences every now and then. Poor timing arises out of misalignment. Struggle is born out of misalignment. The aligned state is the flow state. Imagine a life immersed in flow state. Oh, the possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;

There were many fascinating experiences at and after the camp. This post is about my first practical experience with NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NLP is the science of self-improvement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a theory developed by a couple of psychologists as they observed the leading psychotherapists of the 60s and tried to break down how these therapists were almost magically able to heal their traumatized clients.
I had written a post a short while ago on conflicts. A lot of the ideas in this post were my interpretations of what I’ve gathered by exploring the theory of NLP via a wonderfully written book called The Structure of Magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s lots of power in language and how we structure our thoughts. The words that we use reveal glimpses of the model of the world in our head. Given that the world is what we perceive of it, gently making changes in this model of the world has the power to unblock and spur growth. This requires carefully constructed open ended questions. That’s a hard and enviable skill to possess. But like any other skill, I think it can be picked up with practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to this practical experience. I attended a workshop by Brenda Mehl (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brendamehl.com/&quot;&gt;http://brendamehl.com/&lt;/a&gt;). It was a 10 min session. Brenda led me through a serious of questions starting with “What’s blocking you?”. I chose “feeling shame and fear about expressing and being assertive about my sexual desires” (more on my rocky sexual history later) as my answer. She followed up with a serious of questions guiding me through my own assumptions. With every answer, she would follow up with another beautifully structured question. At the end of the session, I noticed a few paths of progress I was unaware of before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this 10 min session was that all of the answers were in my head. She had instructed me to not say them out loud. It was purely the power of the questions coupled with my intent to introspect.
I was quite impressed. Since then I’ve found myself recommending her free initial session to Mohit and Pramod while discussing growth blockers. If you think there’s a belief you hold that prevents you from making progress, I’d highly recommend reaching out to Brenda (brenda@brendamehl.com) and reading the book — The Structure of Magic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Enlightenment is NOT an end state]]></title><description><![CDATA[I don’t remember who I was chatting with when this came up.

It was either Aaron or Maria at Esalen. There were so many amazing, open people full of fascinating ideas that attribution is very difficult. Attribution is moot anyways. No idea is original. Your ideas are regurgitated jigsaw puzzles with each piece collected over your lifetime. Each piece in itself is a jigsaw puzzle built by the person you borrowed the piece from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways back to the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the Vipassana, I’ve been fascinated by the notion of enlightenment. I understood that enlightenment is a state of being with infinite compassion and complete equanimity. The Vipassana flipped my understanding on the achievability of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That phrasing however implicitly assumes that enlightenment is an end state. That once you get there, there is no more progress to be made. This contradicts my life philosophy. There is always progress to be made. There is no end goal. The process of progress is a way of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect the same extends to enlightenment. Building equanimity is and will always remain a work in progress. You can never achieve complete equanimity. Equanimity is defined with response to external events. It’s the ability to be even in reacting to all external triggers. By definition, you can never be ‘completely’ equanimous. Because once you realize you are equanimous towards a certain pattern of triggers, you can break each trigger down into a sequence of triggers and build equanimity at the end of each. Triggers lie along the time axis. Time is infinitely divisible. As you build more self awareness, you’ll be able to observe minute triggers. And you’ll work to build equanimity at the end of this trigger and not just at the end of a set of the minute triggers. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the Buddha didn’t think he had achieved an end state of enlightenment. I suspect he thought there was more to be achieved. It’s just that he was working to build equanimity at a scale that was invisible to the average Ego trapped human. So from the perspective of society, he had “attained enlightenment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same notion applies to almost every skill set you can think of. The average software engineer probably doesn’t think E13 Waseem Ahmad needs to hone his skills further. But if you ask Waseem, he will tell you the stuff he can improve upon. Same holds for cricket and Sachin Tendulkar. Tennis and Roger Federer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End states are an Egotic concept designed to keep you focussed on a goal in the future rather than developing a system and enjoying the process in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Sept 2018&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This builds up on what I wrote above about Enlightenment not being an end state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment is characterized by Equanimity. Equanimity is a state of being where emotions generated by events are restricted to the time frame of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eg. if a car cuts you off while driving, your anger is restricted to that event itself and subsides once that ‘car cutting you off’ event has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quicker an emotion subsides after the event ends, the more equanimous one is and the farther one is along the path of Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’ve seen people like this around you. They seem zen as fuck. Nothing seems to faze them and they are able to act in the trickiest of situations. They’re just farther along than you are on this path and just as is the case with most skills, concerted effort can get you (and me) closer to or even ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming an exponential decay of emotions, we could define a ‘half life’ for them (akin to radioactive half life). The half life value will vary depending upon the emotion and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@viggiereggae/ego-vs-identity-f2a1ad4c6511&quot;&gt;Identity trait that generates it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the metric I propose for Enlightenment is the &lt;strong&gt;median half life of emotions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some emotions tend to have a longer half life than others. Eg. anger and sexual excitement vs happiness. If you want to reduce the median half life of your emotions, it would thence make sense to leverage the emotions with longer half lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anger and annoyance can shed light into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html&quot;&gt;pieces of your Identity&lt;/a&gt; and your insecurities. There are many ways to tap into sexuality for spiritual growth which I’ll write about later.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On extreme emotions]]></title><description><![CDATA[Expression of extreme emotions is honesty.

Per axiom 4 (Truth, internal and external, is the way of life), it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rage is honest. Crying is honest. Euphoria is honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized this in a conversation with Aaron at the Esalen Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are perceived societal expectations on the expressions of intense emotions. It’s “improper” to cry in public or burst out in public. This societal constraint arises from the assumption that extreme emotions take longer to subside. This derives from the Egotic permanence of emotions that all of us are used to. In fact, it’s the opposite. Extreme expression of emotions allows them an outlet. They escape through this outlet. It’d be even better to track those extreme emotions that could lead to harm eg. rage before they get extreme. But stifling it once it’s arisen is dishonesty. To yourself. To the people you communicate with. Instead it’s better to find an outlet that won’t harm others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extreme expression of emotion also communicates something to the people you interact with. Something that they’re perhaps blind to otherwise. It communicates information. It allows them an opportunity to empathize. To be human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stifling extreme emotions doesn’t work either. They get even stronger and eventually find a way out. It’s time efficient to address them and provide an outlet the moment you find one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bianca had hosted an event a few weeks ago on ‘Gendered Contradictions’. We discussed expectations that the society has of both genders that you disagree with. My response to that was that I don’t like how men are not supposed to cry. Especially in public. I’ve lived most of my life being blind to my emotions. Till this unhealthy relationship with my gut came to a complete breakdown along with my marriage and work life. Ever since, the emotions have flowed. There was a lot of pain which induced a lot of healing. As I got over the end of a 9 year relationship with someone I still truly care about, there was a lot of crying. Initially, I’d try to wait till I returned home to cry. Then it was finding empty conference rooms or running to bathrooms. Very often in my 1–1s with my then manager, Nick. I feel lucky to have had a manager who handled all the corner case scenarios I threw at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one time when I was conducting a meditation event at Facebook on an especially hard day, I started crying. Jesse was the only other attendee at that event. His presence was comforting. That was a turning point for me. I saw the futility of trying to hide tears. It’s an immoral waste of time in pursuit of maintaining your Ego. Maintaining this false impression that I’ve got everything under control and nothing in my life that can cause an extreme emotion. Or even if I have an extreme emotion, I don’t express it the way other ‘weaker’ humans do. That notion was comparative and hence Egotic in nature. Since then I have not hesitated crying in public, when I feel emotions bubbling up. Last week, I heard that my grandma had fallen sick. I felt deep sorrow mixed with a lot of guilt for not calling often enough and then some more guilt for not having visited India in 2 years. I started crying at my desk. Funnily enough I was able to work through it and the emotions subsided in a couple of minutes. Impermanence. Anicca.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had once mentioned to Nick in a 1–1, a trait that my idea of a utopian work culture would possess. One where people cried when they felt like it and everyone else knew that it was no big deal because they also cried when they felt like it. Imagine how much time it’d save that people usually spend hurrying to toilets, or trying to find an empty conference room, not doing work while crying or maintaining low productivity while stifling the emotions so they can go home and cry. All in a futile effort to protect the Ego when it should be whacked at every opportunity you get till it surrenders and succumbs to you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On conflicts]]></title><description><![CDATA[Every person has a model of the universe in their head.

This model is something they’ve built by perceiving the world through the five senses over years. This model is heavily influenced by the circumstances of their childhood and the society in which they grew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model contains a mapping of intentions to actions. What intentions lead to what actions. When is it ok to speak up. When they should acquiesce. What level of thought is sufficient before sharing an idea. What is construed as politeness. What is construed to be disrespectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is communicated to others via language. Language itself is fuzzy. Every word has a spectrum of meaning. What you mean by a word may not be what it means to someone else. Language is a down sampling of thought. Thoughts exist in a higher dimensional universe. Language tries it’s best to capture the richness of thought. “I am annoyed” could mean “I am feeling a bit annoyed right now but will probably get over it in another 20 min” to some or “I’m really annoyed and it’s gonna bother me for the next couple of days” to someone else. Each of these longer statements themselves encode fuzziness of meaning into them. How often is the subject correct about their own estimates? What does the subject mean by “really” or “a bit”? This is the information that is lost when thought is downsampled into language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone hears the subject speak, the words pass through the listener’s own model of the world and gain meaning. A careful listener who knows the subject well may develop over time their own perception of the subject’s model of the world. And pass the words through that perceived model instead of their self model. “Oh when John say’s he is annoyed, it’ll last for 20 min before he gets distracted by something else”. Maintaining models for everyone you interact requires a great deal of effort and you default to your own models in many situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The root source of conflicts is the mismatch between the model that converts thought into words and the model that receives words and upsamples it back into thoughts. Like in a game of telephone, the thoughts end up distorted. This can be an expensive waste of time especially when one finds oneself in a heated argument only to realize that the folks involved in the argument were arguing about totally different things. Even worse is to not even realize that and end up assuming that you just had the misfortune of interacting with an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active listening combined with the ability to ask open-ended, non-leading questions can reduce the amount of time you waste in conflicts. Active listening involves completely focusing your mental faculties on the words that your conversation partner emits and holding off on putting them through your language-thought model till you’ve gained enough information about what the talker means when she uses a specific word. The latter is aided by the ability to ask open-ended questions. Open ended questions typically start with What, How or Why. These questions allow the talker to share information about her model of the world and allow you to better process the words you’ve been holding in your active memory. This is the core skill set that therapists work on building. I suspect that stellar people managers also possess these skills. Really good therapists are able to construct world models of their clients and figure out where the holes in these models lie. The right open-ended question can then help the client fill in these holes and leave therapy with a richer model of the world with better optionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An elevator pitch for Vipassana]]></title><description><![CDATA[Our senses are our doorway to the world.

External information and triggers flow in through them. These triggers generate sensations on the sensory doors.
The egotic mind reacts to sensations with cravings or aversions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You like something. You develop a craving for it. It goes away. You experience misery because you wanted more of it.
You dislike something. You develop an aversion for it. You experience misery because you want it to go away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This semi constant state of misery is experienced as stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ages, we have devised many modes of ‘battling stress’. Watching movies, exercising, playing games, drinking, smoking up, chatting with close friends, writing, making art, dancing, eating good food, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modes serve as much needed oases of mental distraction before we lapse back into our usual stressful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modes come with their own costs in the form of time, money and constraints in the form of location, company, occasion, etc. You need to commit 3h for a movie, pay $10 for the ticket and need to physically go to a theatre to watch it. Sometimes as the cravings for a specific mode strengthen, one may reduce constraints and thereby build addiction. Instead of waiting for a happy hour to start drinking, you pop open a bottle of wine every evening with dinner, thereby loosening the constraint to indulge the craving. Instead of going to a theatre for a movie, you get a Netflix subscription and watch one every other evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This loosening of constraints is catalyzed by Capitalism. Capitalism fuels itself with Growth. Growth requires Consumerism. Consumerism survives by loosening the constraints of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These modes come with effects that last for varying periods of time. Almost like a half life. So the mental distraction you source by watching a movie lasts a certain number of days before you need to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most modern forms of meditation are another mode of mental distraction eg. distracting your mind by moving focus to the breath or by running through a visualization exercise or by developing a chant as a trigger to distract your mind onto a powerful, unfathomable idea like devotion to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage in this mode of mental distraction is that the cost is low and the constraints are weak. Once you train yourself in meditative breathing exercises, you pay no money and need about 10–15 minutes of time for one ‘hit’. You don’t need to go to any specific place to do this because your breath is always with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been indulging in this mode of mental distraction for the last couple of years. I’ve found it to be very convenient. I start craving it if I happen to skip it for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the root source of misery continues and these modes are just means of chopping off some heads of the Hydra if she grows one too many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This root source is the reactionary pattern that the Egotic mind has towards sensations. Imagine cutting off this reactionary pattern at its root! You won’t need the periodic indulgence in mental distraction modes to live a ‘stress-free’ life that so many of us desire!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the elevator pitch for the Vipassana technique. Gautam the Buddha realized that the flaw in this reactionary pattern is the expectation/concern that positive/negative sensations should/will last forever. So the Vipassana technique discovered by Gautam the Buddha focusses on the notion of ‘impermanence’ (अनिच्च in Pali or अनित्य in Sanskrit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything in this world is impermanent. The scale of the impermanence may vary. A rock may seem more permanent than a fly. But fundamentally, everything is impermanent. So acting with the expectation or concern that something should or will be permanent is just plain foolish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idea makes logical sense to me. However, Vipassana emphasizes that understanding this idea intellectually doesn’t suffice. This is because the reactionary pattern in your mind is a System 1 trait (in TFS terminology) (also called the ‘reptile brain’ sometimes) whereas logic is a System 2 trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of impermanence needs to be jammed right before the reactionary block inside the mental circuitry. The Vipassana technique is the answer that the Buddha discovered that enables this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique relies on scanning your body from head to toe and noticing sensations. Good sensations in the form of tingles and bad ones in the form of pain because you’re probably not used to sitting cross legged on the floor for too long. In addition to this, you keep a watchful eye on your mind and see how it starts desiring more of the good sensations and less of the pain. So as your scanning, it will tend to linger on the parts of your body which feel good and skip the ones that don’t. This is where the training comes in. You remind your mind that either sensation is impermanent. And force it to move at an even pace through out the body. Same amount of time spent on the good sensations as well as the bad sensations. In some of the 1h long sittings, I observed that doing this sometimes caused the perceptibly ‘physical’ pain in my knees to disappear. Almost as if the nerve endings there were calling for my brain’s attention so I would respond by releasing my cross legged stance but then gave up once they realized that it wasn’t happening. The ‘pain’ came back again of course and I noticed how my mind responded with an aversion to that return and a craving for victory over the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since coming back from Vipassana, I’ve tried to stick to the recommended 1h per morning and evening sittings to train in this technique with abject failure. Funnily enough, I’ve not meditated much at all since returning because I’d tell myself to do Vipassana and end up doing nothing. I realized that I had found it easier to build a Headspace/MBSR focussed meditation practice because I had gotten addicted to that mental distraction mode. I would crave the tingly body scan and the mental release at the end when Andy Puddicombe instructs you to let go of your mind and allow it to do what it wants to do and your mind just settles down calmly like a puppy that’s been tugging at a leash because you were holding onto it but doesn’t know what to do once you let go of the leash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Vipassana as a habit is going to be much harder because I can’t rely on the craving to build a habit. Weirdly enough, my main motivation to build a Vipassana practice seems Egotic in nature. It’s the desire to attain enlightenment because “holy crap, wouldn’t that be sick?!”. I sometimes wonder if the Ego could be led to its own demise by indulging in this specific Egotic desire. I am afraid that everything I’ve learnt about the Ego tells me that it’s a very smart beast and won’t be fooled so easily. I suspect that at some point, I’ll have to find a stronger motivation to continue Vipassana because Egotic motivations are accompanied by impatience because they focus on the end result in the future instead of the process in the present. Impatience is the most common and strongest foe I face in many endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

I try to live by these axioms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.01³⁶⁵ = 37.78 (relates to the compounding nature of self-improvement efforts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html&quot;&gt;Keep your identity small&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix more, whine less (borrowed from a t-shirt I had gotten as an intern at FB in 2011)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.dilbert.com/post/102964992706/goals-vs-systems&quot;&gt;Focus on systems rather than goals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deeply believe in all of these principles. However, there seems to be some overlap between them. Ideally axioms should be designed in a manner where there is no overlap. That allows a minimal set of axioms to define a life philosophy. Decision making is quicker if you have a small set of axioms to guide you. It’s akin to finding the eigenvectors of a matrix. Overlap suggests that there are more fundamental axioms that prop these principles up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been mulling this over the recent past. Life axioms are a set of principles that can explain all actions in your life. They form the independent axes of your value system. I realized that I’ve updated my life axioms to the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time is the only resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information is the only currency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events are not good or bad — just information transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truth, internal and external, is the only way of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still some overlap between 1 and 2. So this is a work in progress (what isn’t really?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we model ourselves as machines, the input is time and the output is everything that adds value to the world. The efficiency of this machine is inversely proportional to the size of the Ego. The Ego is at the root of all hurdles. Death of the Ego maximizes efficiency. At the Vipassana, I learnt that the death of the Ego is synonymous with enlightenment. I also learnt a definition for enlightenment — it’s a state of complete equanimity (i.e. #3). From therein, sprouts a fountain of infinite love and compassion. Before the Vipassana, I thought that enlightenment was beyond the reach of the average human and was reserved for some special folks like the Buddha. After trying out the Vipassana technique, I believe deep inside that enlightenment is accessible to everyone. The technique just makes complete sense (more on that, later). In hindsight, I also realize that this was an example of the linear thinking that our brains are constrained by, that makes us think that things are out of our reach when most things are a few phase transitions away. Like imagine a block of ice at -20C thinking it’ll always remain solid doesn’t matter how much it increases its temperature, and getting validated in its belief all the way through -15C, -10C, -1C and then suddenly experiences a drastic change at 0C. And looks back and goes “oh that wasn’t that difficult”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempt to live by these axioms but I often fail. Which is fine (see #3😉).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination of #1 and #2 means I try to ask a lot of open-ended questions. Sometimes I get so engrossed in this that I come across as interrogative — like I’m in a hurry to gather all information I can in the time I have. Then I have to remind myself to ease up lest I drive away the source of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3 means I almost always say yes to an event I haven’t experienced yet and try to zone in on situations that embarrass me and work towards getting to a point where they don’t embarrass me. Embarrassment is a great tool. I think it’s the tool I’ve leveraged the most in my personal battle against my Ego. It exposes insecurities. Insecurities are the building blocks of the Ego. Openness about insecurities weakens these blocks. I’ve been trying to do a lot of that. Openly talk about my weaknesses and insecurities. I think that works very well partly because people are more hesitant to leverage your weaknesses against you if you openly declare them. Lately, I’ve found some of my insecurities being supplanted by an egotic pride of having fewer insecurities. The Ego is a tricky bastard. I’m not sure what the solution for this is. I think it’s better to have one egotic aspect to deal with than multiple insecurities because then you can track better when your actions are being driven by that egotic aspect and prevent those actions from happening.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest amongst these axioms has been #4. I have borrowed this axiom from this verse that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/pramod.konanur?fref=mentions&quot;&gt;Pramod&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;सत्यम ब्रूयात प्रियं ब्रूयात न ब्रूयात सत्यम अप्रियं |
प्रियं च नानृतं ब्रूयात एषधर्मः सनातनः ||
Speak truth in such a way that it should be pleasing to others.
Never speak truth, which is unpleasant to others.
Never speak untruth, which might be pleasant.
This is the path of eternal morality, sanatana dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s insane how many times I’ve gone back to this verse or showed it to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been attempting a modification of step 1. &lt;em&gt;Always&lt;/em&gt; speak truth that is pleasing to others which translates to giving sincere compliments whenever they occur to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 translates to not being mean. In terms of the axioms up above, I see it as a corollary of #2 and #3. People, who you are mean to, close themselves up to you. You may be truthful, but that truth won’t transmit if your receptor decides to shut the doors. Information transmission failures are a waste of time. Waste of time violates #1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found Step 3 to be very difficult. At least in American or Indian culture where insincere praise seems to commonly fall under “being nice”. Perhaps the difficulty level of these steps varies depending upon what culture you’ve grown up in. I wonder if ease of getting to enlightenment also correspondingly varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t fully understand the role Truth plays in the path to enlightenment. I do believe that Truth reduces overall cognitive load. You don’t have to maintain complex mental models of the realities you’ve painted in front of different people (eg. this is what my work colleagues know vs. this is what my friends know). So it likely contributes to your overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnote — these ideas have been borrowed from Naval Ravikant, Nicholas Nassim Taleb, Eckhart Tolle, SN Goenka, Scott Adams and some systems thinking books.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attempting a Vegetarian Diet]]></title><description><![CDATA[There’s so much I want to share from my Vipassana experience.

I’ve been meaning to write up about it. I was holding back to make one large post but I think that’s holding me back from sharing the things that come at random moments to my mind. So I’ve decided to go ahead and offload my stream of consciousness onto Facebook every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly happy about managing to sticking to a vegetarian diet since returning. I’ve been consciously tracking my urges to eat non-veg. And to my pleasant surprise, I have not noticed any particularly strong cravings. My gut seems to be doing fine too — even with some veggies I had blacklisted before as high FODMAP. Last night was a particularly hard test as there was some delicious looking lamb. And I was stress af. And I binge eat when I’m stressed. I picked up a piece and stared at it for 5 min on my plate and did not end up eating it. I’m not sure how “keto” I am now since fruits have made a reappearance in my diet. My obsession with eggs and bacon has been replaced with a new found obsession on apple and peanut butter. Partly because apple and peanut butter reminds me of Adam who introduced me to that snack and that makes me happy and mostly because IT IS SOOO GOOOD. I’ve found a low glycemic load breakfast item that I really love — oats mixed with cottage cheese, flax seeds and blueberries. I also find myself particularly craving cucumbers in the morning. I also discovered a smoothie combo that I’ve really taken to — banana, almond milk, lots of peanut butter and flax seeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a hardcore meat eater as recently as February. I cut out red meat using a particularly hardcore binge at a Mongolian hot pot place as a trigger event. Stuck to fish, chicken and eggs for March/April. I’m hoping this event will establish my vegetarian diet with some room for occasional meat intake if my body really desires it. Too early to declare myself as a vegetarian. These declarations feed into your identity ergo ego anyways. Best avoided. I’ll have to test it out with a proper workout routine, which I’m easing back into because my hips are sore from logging hours of sitting cross legged on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh I completely missed addressing the motivation behind even attempting this. “Harm no living being” was one of the five precepts we attempted to adhere to during the Vipassana which naturally leads to vegetarianism. I’m not yet totally sure how this relates to spiritual growth but I’m a firm believer in faking it till you make it. And mimicking people you perceive to be better than you in any domain you want to grow in. I want to grow spiritually. I’ve observed a common trend of vegetarianism amongst people I perceive to be spiritually more advanced (whatever that means).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a suspicion that optimizing your diet to reduce inflammation is The Right Answer®. And there’s probably some link between your digestive system getting confused by food that is similar to your physical structure and ringing the alarm bells and increasing inflammation in preparation for defending the body. And perhaps keeping inflammation low means that your neural system can better focus on spiritual growth because the house is no longer on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other piece to this puzzle is that I suspect we’ve been using the wrong metrics to quantify diets i.e. macros (carbs, protein, fat). This is a 20% suspicion partly induced by some reference I came across in Ray Cronise’s work. I came across Ray online from my cold therapy ‘experiments’. He did similar experiments to mine but in a much more scientific manner. He has been challenging the daily macros paradigm. I haven’t read enough into this but he seems like a legit guy. It resonates with what I’ve read about systems thinking. The body is a complex system and the macro split is too simplistic a view of what is needed to fuel such a complex system. Imagine that! Optimizing based on incorrect metric for ages — no wonder we have so many different diet solutions because each probably hits close to home on the actual hidden metric that we don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two research papers Ray published are &lt;a href=&quot;bit.ly/WinterNeverComes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;bit.ly/oxidativepriority&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meditation & Fitness]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve claimed in the past that meditation has helped me with my physical fitness efforts.

I was unable to verbalize what I meant by this other than “it’s increased my self-awareness”. I now have a pseudo-scientific theory on how it has worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna be specific about what I’m referring to when I say meditation. I’m referring to the body scan exercise. It’s a routine where you move your attention all over the surface of your body starting from head to toe and then back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you move your attention around, you start noticing various types of sensations. Pain. Itching. Tickling. Tingly goosebumps. On a day where I’m feeling particularly alert, I’ve been able to sweep up and down in a couple of breaths and feel myself being enveloped in a tingly goosebump layer and go into a trance like state where I lost all track of time. A body high not unlike the kind that smoking up some Indica has gotten me. It was mind blowing to me that I could achieve the same feeling purely with my mind that I could by consuming an intoxicant. There is a downside to this sensation because all sorts of addictions are egotic in nature but we’ll come back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the topic of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re scanning your body, the command center of your nervous system (your brain) is checking in with the frontline troops (the endpoints of the nerves). Doing this periodically strengthens the neural transport infrastructure of your body. What this means is that you are better able to sense changes on more parts of your body than you were able to before. And also better able to send instructions to specific parts of your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting off on meditation, I used to struggle with the specific instructions that say yoga teachers give (eg. create space in your lower back, create space between your pelvis and lower abs etc.) Lately, I’ve been able to follow these instructions almost to the dot. Which means I’m better able to pick up the form that a teacher is trying to communicate to me. At its core, this is an improvement in the efficiency of the time I invest in working out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique of Vipassana is essentially the body scan. But just like with every exercise, learning it under the right teacher means you get the form right. On Day 4, when we started doing the body scans, I noticed a huge blind spot on my front torso, especially my tummy. I introspected on this in the ample silent free time and realized this has something to do with my mental body image. My brain has not yet fully adapted to the recent (~2 years) changes in my physical structure. In my brain, I’m 50 lb heavier. And that difference between my mental body image and my physical body is most prominent on my tummy and my chin. This is something I’ve known for a while. If my conversation with you has gone beyond small talk, I’ve probably mentioned that in my head, I’m a fat kid. My refusal to accept the size of my tummy for most of my life led to a few things including this blind spot, a hunch in my upper back as I subconsciously walked in a way designed to “hide” my tummy as much as I can and my tendency to sleep on the side in a semi-fetal position. The chin discrepancy is something I realized as I was trying out something that Hannes had suggested I do in the lovely text full of advice he sent right before I switched off my phone. He asked me to not look at my reflection in the mirror to further increase the sensory deprivation. I tried this on days 2,3,4. Every time I passed by the mirror, I’d catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and then my brain would fill out the rest. It was always a fatter me specifically with a double chin. I panicked on day 5 and skipped this exercise. After further introspection, I realize that this might be enhanced due to the image I have on my DL (&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgur.com/a/KRCIxh9&quot;&gt;https://imgur.com/a/KRCIxh9&lt;/a&gt;) which is something I still see on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What I look forward to at the Vipassana]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’m going fully off the grid for the next 10 days as I immerse myself in my first Vipassana meditation and silence camp.

&lt;p&gt;The rules include silence, no phone, no reading, no writing, no eye contact, only vegetarian food and complete sexual abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effectively the opposite of how I live my life. I’m super excited about this fascinating experiment. I’ve been waiting a long time for it. I tried to go for this last summer as a means of furthering my spiritual journey but then I went down with physical fatigue due to mono and sleep apnea, hip injury and ACL in quick succession and had to postpone it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this timing is great though because I had not built a daily meditation practice back then and there was progress to do on my own without external help. Lately I feel like I’ve hit some kind of plateau with respect to meditation so this would be a good push forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have lived a life instinctively running away from emotions either by squashing them subconsciously (pre-2016) or just immersing myself in activities to leave very little time for being with myself (post-2016). This will be a good outlet for connecting with my subconscious and understanding myself better. Which is the key to self-improvement. You improve quicker if you know the baseline better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m most excited to see what a phone/Internet free life would look like. I broke up with the TV 2 years ago mostly because I’d fall asleep so easily (sleep apnea) that I could never follow any plot line and partly because I get bored very easily. I’m very happy about that serendipitous change because not having Huflix subscriptions has saved me money (~time) and time that I can invest in other pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am what some would call a social media spammer. And I’d vehemently disagree with those who wouldn’t. I think social media has great benefits (spoiler alert- I work at a social media giant). But I find that push notifications are designed to distract you from whatever you are focussed on. It’s like having an extremely needy puppy. Like 60 of them. Always seeking your attention. And not nearly as cute. So I wonder if this event would trigger my breakup with my phone. I think that’d be a sick result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also psyched to see how 10 days of simple, vegetarian diet suits me. I checked in at 170.4 lb today morning. 10lb down plus I’ve noticed slivers of relaxed state ab definition in the 8 weeks since I’ve participated in a lifestyle challenge that a bud of mine kicked off. I feel like I’ve pushed myself in a corner diet wise in terms of what I include in my daily intake — no red meat, no high FODMAP veggies, no sugar, no wheat, rice, starch. And I’ll probably have to re-evaluate for operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is clear from the length of this post, this is something I’ve been mulling over for a while. I had not accounted for the no reading/writing rule though. I had made grand plans about writing and making comics and reading a tonne. But like they say, life happens while you’re busy making plans. So this is gonna be an added challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final aspect is that of complete sexual abstinence. Horny people make poor choices. I’ve heard rumors about advanced meditators gaining control of their sexual desires. That doesn’t mean they don’t enjoy sex. It just means that the desire doesn’t occur randomly and drive their decisions as much as it does for the average person. It’s akin to gaining power over your emotions. You don’t stop having emotions. You are just no longer a slave to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist is that there’s lots to look forward to and dive into. And I am super psyched about this experience!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On losing weight]]></title><description><![CDATA[On the occasion of hitting 50lb* net weight loss, here’s my journey so far.

&lt;p&gt;This is my third (and hopefully final attempt) to move down from 100 kg. 100 kg has always been a trigger weight for me where I wake up from some kind of a deep slumber and start working on reducing my bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one was ~25lb drop in first couple of years of undergrad (2005–07) because of healthy but not so tasty mess food. I wasn’t even aware that it happened. Then I discovered Domino’s 3–6 offer and started guzzling 1l of Mountain Dew every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second attempt was in final year of undergrad (2010) after getting the grad school admits. I got scared of coming to the Land of the Free and Obese while weighing 100 kg already. I had visions of being lifted out of my apartment by a crane because I was too heavy for my legs. That attempt was mostly cardio focussed. 1h swimming or running everyday along with eating pulses and reducing rice. Lots of subway sandwiches every day. That’s when I tried calorie counting for the first time. But the diet changes were drastic and relied heavily on my mom’s cooking. So once grad school started, I stopped running and swimming and got tired of Subway sandwiches and piled it back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This attempt truly started in 2013 when I started basic conditioning with a gym trainer. I vividly remember failing at an unweighted squat because I had no core strength whatsoever and had a tire around my waist. I gradually got into lifting and worked my way up to body weight squat 5x5s while still remaining at around 220 lb. Each time I’d get to around 250lb, my hip flexors would tap out and I’d inflame them. I’d take a break and get back to empty bar and work my way up. It took me three cycles to realize that I should go to a physio. Back and front muscle chain mobility is now one of my core goals for 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got into climbing in 2014 and really enjoyed it but never got past 5.10b because I didn’t have proper technique and was lugging around too much extra weight. Climbing was exhilarating and I pushed myself. To the point that there was an evening where I found myself behind the steering wheel of my car parked in a desolate Sunnyvale parking lot unable to move my arms to even make a phone call. I sat there for a good 30 min before I regained use of my arms. I decided to take a break from climbing and come back to it once I had shed the extra luggage (still haven’t gotten back to it 😛 because I hurt my hip and knee in quick succession after I had shed the luggage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third attempt started when I was on a trip to Goa with some of my undergrad mates. I saw some pictures (I never liked taking pictures of myself. No prizes for guessing why 😛) and was horrified. An engaging conversation with Abhishek Tiwari and I was ready to count calories again. That’s when this attempt began at 225 lb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recurring pattern I’ve observed and was also pointed out to me by Tom Hirschfeld is that whenever I weigh myself everyday and look at the charts, I lose weight. So I invested in an Aria WiFi scale in Jan 2016. I’ve been on a project of minimizing my belongings for a few months now but I’ll carry that scale with me to my death bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main difference in this attempt was that it was a gradual lifestyle change. Focused on one habit change at a time and once it was an established part of my routine, I reassessed, looked at the next habit I could build and focused on that. Rinse and repeat. Every habit was built when there was sufficient incentive to build it. Incentives were dug up by finding and engaging in diverse experiences. That latter part comes naturally to me because I get bored easily. The rest of it just followed smoothly once these links were established. It’s a very capitalist manner of working with yourself. It fucking works as does capitalism for the most parts ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing this chart is missing is meditation and cold therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking cold showers in Nov 2016 on a whim after a fun evening with Waj and stuck to it because it helped me with my depression. And then I discovered an entire community and whole new goals. I’m confident it’s improved my BMR which I suspect played a role in restricting my weight gain to 5lb while I was recovering from my ACL surgery during the holiday season of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was the kind of guy who mocked people for meditating. Harshad Maral can attest to it. “Dude, just do it once you are 60. There are more fun things to do right now”. I truly believed that because I observed mostly old people getting into it. Classic correlation-causation fallacy. I signed up on ClassPass in Jan 2016 because as we established, I bore easily so it seemed like the most amazing idea to me at $79 per month for unlimited. I was in San Francisco then. So obviously, 80% of the options on it were yoga studios. I gave it a shot and fell in love with Ritual Hot Yoga! Strength training, flexibility, sauna and stress reduction in a 50 min duration. What’s not to love! I got addicted to hot yoga as a means of battling stress at a chaotic SF startup. I noticed a couple of patterns then and in the swimming I did the summer after. Whenever my breathing was in sync with my movements, I’d get into these flow states where time just floated by effortlessly. Once I noticed this, I felt incentivized enough to explore meditative breathing exercises. The way it’s helped me with my weight loss is that I’ve built conscious body awareness through it. I can better figure out how I respond to different food items and iterate quicker on my diet.
The rest of my journey is charted in this image because I got bored of typing another 1000 words.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge incentivized me to step up the rate of my diet experimentation. I quit alcohol and red meat. Switched to a fish/egg focussed (with some chicken) diet for most of it. Then in the last 3 weeks, spurred by a Vipassana that I attended, I’m doing a vegetarian diet experiment. Most of these changes were induced by tracking my bodily urges with a little bit of push here and there. And trying to disassociate them from my memory urges (fond memories of consuming alcohol, steak, chicken tandoori). In these three weeks, I’ve found myself be super excited by the prospect of eating vegetarian food like nut butter, swiss chard, spinach, oats, apples, cucumbers which is a very new experience for me. So I suspect this is quite sustainable mentally speaking. I’ll have to evaluate how this helps or hinders my health progress. I suspect a plant based diet is what I’m gonna equilibriate on. But right now, I’m super new to this and am probably not “doing it right”. So it’s gonna need a few iterations. I’ll add that the motivations for moving towards the plant-based diets are 40% spiritual. But if I find that it’s really hindering me from getting jacked, I’ll reevaluate. I’m fairly confident and happy that alcohol and red meat are out for good though. Good riddance. Eggs, fish and chicken — I’m not fully sure yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not stick to any periodic routine as such. Did a bunch of things that my body felt like doing, when it felt like doing. Started off with a 100 pushups, situps, squats challenge. Did a lot of hiking, yoga/hot yoga and dancing, with a tsp of swimming, pole dancing, aerial hoops (tried it out for the first time!) and rock climbing. My main goal for this year is to build a rock solid core so I think my routine going forward is going to be pole (1x per week), hoops (1x), swimming (1x per week), hot yoga (~3x) plus hiking and dance for fun.
I’ll see how that goes. This haphazard routine fits well with my ADD tendencies so it involves very little mental effort. This routine will also hopefully help my open up my hip flexors which are the major blocker in lifting. Once that happens (and hopefully I’ve equilibriated on a plant based diet), I’ll probably do a 2–3 month lifting sprint because I’m a tad bit envious of the muscle definition #gainz some others have had with it the last 12 weeks and because I still hold egotic ambitions of entering the 1000lb club. I also come out of this challenge fairly convinced I need to add some form of HIIT to my routine.
I had a few slump weeks (= ate chocolates, baked goods, pizza, fries) here and there. Induced usually by work stress or just fatigue because I pushed myself too hard or was experimenting too much with my diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge had a $30 buy-in. Overall, it was a great way to spend that money. I’d recommend doing it if you get an opportunity. The format is pretty easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get people to join in with a monetary buy in. This is important because monetary buy in is a good indicator of intent. You need people with strong intent of improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add gamification by declaring winners who get money. Games are fun especially when leveraged towards your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up a spreadsheet like the one below. You really only need to track weight (You should get a wifi-connected scale if you don’t have one yet. Like drop what you’re doing now and get one.) and body fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Daily — Weigh yourself everyday with wifi-connected scale which syncs automatically and shows you pretty graphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly — Every Monday morning, measure body-fat using Jackson-Pollack 3pt method (details below) and take progress pics — &lt;em&gt;relaxed&lt;/em&gt; front, back and side. This Monday morning routine will take 15 min the first time you do it as you are figuring stuff out. And 4 min every Monday after that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add some “homework” every week which basically serves as a reminder to people that they’re still in the challenge — comment with what food you ate, comment with how many times you cheated, comment with your workout routine. This builds accountability.
That’s pretty much it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t trust digital measuring devices. They are VERY WRONG.
Buy a caliper. Use Jackson-Pollack 3pt method.

Get a DXA scan before, after if you can afford it (optional).
If you’ve read this far, I’d also HIGHLY recommend you get a fat measurement done ASAP. It’ll dispel all myths you hold about how fit you are. Check out the attached wiki table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obesity is such an epidemic these days that our baselines are completely screwed up. Once you measure, you’ll know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt; Jun 2018 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a DXA body scan during my trip to Menlo Park. I found it super useful and plan to do one every six months.
Attaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/taum7i0b4gixftx/bodyspec-results-viggie.pdf?dl=0&quot;&gt;my results&lt;/a&gt; so you can see what kind of data this scan gets you about your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my main takeaway.
There’s two types of fat in your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat is fat surrounding vital organs. I have 1lb of it right now. This fat can and should be zero. The more you have it, the likelier you’ll be diseased in old age. This is colloquially referred to as ‘skinny fat’. If you look thin but have a crappy diet (sugar and other simple carbs), it’s likely that you have visceral fat. This fat content is impossible to figure out without a DXA scan — caliper methods (eg. Jackson Pollack), body impedance measurements and water volume displacement won’t get you this value. Get a DXA done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fat is diet driven. Cutting out sugar, wheat, rice, potatoes? should suffice to drive this value down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other fat is subcutaneous. This is the fat that’s visible and sits under your skin. I have 33.6 lb of it right now (majority of my fat content). That brings my BF % to 20.6% which puts me at 70 %ile of men my age. A goal I have in life is to be at 90 %ile across a variety of domains. Per that, I’ve updated my short term BF target to 15%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This number is higher than the numbers I’ve gotten from Jackson-Pollack or the weighing scales with body impedance measurements. I’m not surprised at this. Most commonly accessible BF measuring modes seem to underestimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other useful piece of info that came out fo this scan is bone density. AFAIU, bone density is easier to build when you’re young and is typically not lost easily (unlike muscles which atrophy pretty quickly if you don’t use them). Bone density is built with heavy lifting and high impact activities. I have not been weightlifting for a couple of years now. Mostly because I’ve found a bunch of other activities that excite me more. One of my concerns about this lifestyle change was that I might be ignoring bone density gainz. But it turns out that my measurements came out at 98%ile. I bet most of this came from barbell lifts which was my main mode of exercise from 2014–2016. So I don’t need to get back into lifting for this reason. Dancing also seems to help with bone density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other surprising but obvious-in-hindsight result was the rest metabolic rate (RMR). I need 1600 cal/day to sustain myself. I had not mentally updated this number from the 2100 cal/day figure I had computed when I calorie counted 2 summers and 57 lb ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tldr; GET A DXA SCAN ASAP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, NYC’s gargantuan city laws means that a DXA scan costs &gt; $300 here and you have to go to a hospital to get it done and may have to jump through a few hoops. It costs $45 with BodySpec in California — so plan it out for your next trip to the inferior coast.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day of Silence at Golden Drum]]></title><description><![CDATA[I did a 1 day silence and meditation retreat at Golden Drum yesterday.

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It started at 8a in the morning. The first hour was an orientation and basic introduction round for all participants. The silence started with breakfast at 9a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence involved no talking. No eye contact. No gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So naturally, I started doing what any self-respecting chatterbox with lifelong weight issues would do. I started wolfing down food. Jerry, the instructor, had advised us to eat 25% less than what we usually do to aid the meditation practice. I ate twice my regular portions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The food was plain and simple vegetarian fare but quite delicious. So that aided the hogging. The ‘but’ is because I’ve been a hardcore meat eater. Especially doubling down over the last couple of years as I moved to a ketogenic diet for weight loss and a low FODMAP diet aimed at cut out a lot of veggies for battling IBS. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After food, I distracted myself via books. Golden Drum is beautifully designed with a living room area lined with fascinating books and a really comfy couch. It’s actually a house where the instructors live and get trained from their teacher. It felt like home. I browsed through ‘I Am That’ and a couple of books by Stephen Mitchell — ‘Tao Te Ching’ and ‘The Second Book of Tao’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find ‘I Am That’ to be a very obscure book that just blows me away the 30% of time that I understand what it’s trying to communicate. I’m gonna grab an original Marathi copy of the book and force myself to read it sometime because a lot can get lost in translation. Given that I was focussed on distracting myself, I couldn’t read it for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked ‘Tao Te Ching’ — it’s a bunch of pithy translated verses. I’ve read most of Stephen Mitchell’s Bhagavat Gita before and I find that he does a great job of translating ancient tomes to make them accessible. ‘The Second Book of Tao’ also contains his interpretations for every verse that it includes. Stephen Mitchell seems like he would make a great dinner guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books could hold my attention for only so long. I finally had to confront myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meditation was split up into 3–4 1h sessions. Going in, I was very concerned about being able to sit with folded legs for a long duration. Alyona, another instructor, was super helpful in ensuring that I could sit up comfortably. It’s critical to have an erect spine otherwise it’s easier to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite sleepy in the first one. The food didn’t help. In the second one, my mind started drifting. I was able to practice bringing it back to my breath. The instructors played some musical tones aimed at reminding us of where we were. These served as guides while the mind was busy spinning its own realities. There was an ‘alignment yoga’ session in between conducted by Alyona. I really liked how detailed and specific her instructions were. I got that much closer to an unsupported headstand, but was held back by concerns of landing on my left leg and hurting the ACL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third meditation session was most powerful. It started off with some Pranayamic heavy breathing. It tired me out while simultaneously filling me up with oxygen. Oxygen high feels great. A tired mind is a less restless mind. I found it easier to get into a clear state of mind. The Wim Hof Method exercises are also designed around these principles. I plan to incorporate some aspect of Pranayamic heavy breathing into my routine. Headspace tends to be slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, the silence was getting really uncomfortable. All sorts of memories and thoughts from the life were floating through. I was trying my best to acknowledge them and move on. But the more I moved on, the more thoughts fluttered through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructors started off on a ‘yin yoga’ session. It involved lying down with some props to stretch and open up specific muscle groups while the instructors collaborated to play some amazing tribal music. There was this particular stretch which I later learnt was known as the ‘heart opener’, which brought all of the underlying emotions that I was running away from brimming to the surface via streams of tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finally broke our collective silence, shared our experience and walked out to a snowy New York evening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Behavioral Psychology and Systems Thinking - A reading list]]></title><description><![CDATA[I’ve been fascinated by the duality of these fields for the past few years.

&lt;p&gt;Behavioral Psychology helps one understand how humans think and the biases that affect our decisions. (eg. Why do more favorable court judgments happen after lunch?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems Thinking talks about how we come together to form systems which act in ways that can seem mysterious if only analyzed by focussing on individuals that make up the system.(e.g. How does a violent mob form from pacifists?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out potential domains of improvement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calibrate yourself in that domain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chart out your next steps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out domains needs you to be open to new experiences and fight the urge to define your comfort zone too early in life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domains fit into three buckets - health, wealth and spirituality allowing for some overlap and dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health: swimming, running, lifting, yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealth: education, career&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spirituality: meditation, yoga&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these buckets are filled with the time and effort you invest in them. You can calibrate yourself in every bucket by guessing what percentile you fall in. Ask yourself, where do I stand with respect to the rest of humanity? The 100%ilers in each of these buckets are familiar to us - say Bolt, Gates and Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us tend to be skewed heavily towards one of the three. For the audience of this post, it’s likely ‘wealth’. Work towards reducing these skews and it should be possible to reach the 90%ile marker in every bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts that you take in every bucket make progress on other buckets easier. Same holds for domains within every bucket. Yoga improves flexibility which makes it easier to lift heavy. Lifting can improve muscles strength that reduces stain during hiking. Wealth can enable easy access to better health facilities and can free up time. Meditation frees up brain time by training you to not get lost in past regrets and future anxieties. Self awareness gained via spiritual efforts makes it easier to not get dragged into heated arguments. It also helps with self calibration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you feel like you’ve hit your limit, remember that nature operates through phase transitions whereas our brain thinks linearly. Have you experienced an occasion where you’ve surprised yourself with what you ever able to accomplish when you thought that you couldn’t? That’s an example of your abilities eclipsing your brain’s linear constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people overestimate what can be achieved in 1 year and underestimate what can be achieved in 10 years. — Bill Gates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase transitions in a domain are made possible by small inconspicuous wins in related domains. When you hit a plateau while trying to make progress in one of these domains, take a step back and figure out easier wins in related domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While charting out next steps for improvement, remember to focus on setting up systems rather than goals. What new habit can I imbibe rather than what next goal can I hit? Set up systems and celebrate goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What systems to set up requires some research. Learn from the Internet and the people around you. Learning from people directly is hard because most people are unaware of what contributes to their own successes. Here it helps to know what questions to ask to tease out learnings from people you converse with. Asking good questions requires active listening. Active listening requires fighting the urge to figure out what your contribution to the conversation is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our societal obsession with small talk also makes it harder to learn from each other. Be the example here. Open up, answer honestly and from the heart. Humans have a tendency to mirror each other and seek social proof for actions. You can be the one who provides that social proof. It’s ok to say you are having a hard time. It’s ok to describe why. Be nonchalant while doing so. People will mimic you and follow suit. The end result is a more genuine interaction. A better use of time. Some will hesitate. That’s fine too. It’s hard to open up. Allow them the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process of self improvement, failures are inevitable. Failures are information transfer mechanisms. They are a critical precursor to step 2 and 3. They make it easier to figure out what next steps you should be focusing on. They are hard to deal with though because our emotions get entangled in them. Our ego is hurt. If only we weren’t slaves to our egos..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up in modern human societies fattens our ego and our identity. I was a Hindu, an Indian, a Mumbaikar, a Marathi even before I could speak. Our identity tends to collect more and more traits as we grow up. Many of these traits are slapped on by our social up bringing rather than via a concerted conscious effort on our part. The later your ego, the easier it is for your ego to be hurt. The more you identify with things, the more fiercely you will defend them. The only difference between a debate and an argument is a sense of identity. Arguments are a waste of time. Time is truly the only resource you have. Save time. Whittle down your ego. Next time you get into an argument, take a step back. Ask yourself why your emotions are rising. What aspect of your ego is causing your emotions to rise up to its defense. Is this aspect something that you truly want to incorporate in your identity? Or is it just something that you picked up along the way? If it’s the latter, shed it. Put your ego on a diet. On a spiritual diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If failures hurt you, that means there are things you can do to improve spiritually. The end result isn’t a robotic emotionless being. It’s someone who is at peace with failures and successes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the three buckets, spirituality has the least obvious effort-fruits relationship. How the fuck do breathing exercises help you diminish your ego?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is unknown. I believe it has something to do with living in the present. Focusing on your breathing is the easiest way there is to focus on the present moment. Once you focus on the present moment, your ego is handicapped. Your ego thrives on the slights and regrets of the past and the anxieties of the future. Focusing your attention on the present moment is your weapon against your ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weaker your ego becomes, the quicker you recover emotionally from failures and embarrassments. The quicker you recover, the more information you can gather from that event. The more information you gather, the easier it is to calibrate and figure out next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can aid you in figuring out next steps for self improvement in specific domains. Seek people who were at your state a few years ago and are now better than you in that domain. Learn from their mistakes. A word of caution while seeking advice. If you want to be amongst the best in a domain, a majority of the advice you get will naturally be mediocre. Be picky when imbibing advice. The best coaches are the ones who listen carefully, take their time to understand you and then help you figure out the one thing you should focus on to improve. Seek the best coaches.&lt;/p&gt;

That prompted me to do a brain dump of the patterns I had observed during my last interview season in late 2016. Figured it might be useful for others too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of load balancers including various routing paradigms — sticky/non-sticky/round-robin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding and picking a good shard key so that you can run the most dominant query on a single shard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design RESTful (or not) APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how to push messages to clients (websockets, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fan-in/Fan-out problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding of messaging queues (Kafka etc) and how they can be used within your backend system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database choice — SQL vs NoSQL (should be able to provide some reasoning for your choice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data modeling the problem for the database of your choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SQL primary keys, foreign keys, &lt;a href=&quot;http://use-the-index-luke.com/&quot;&gt;what indexes you will use&lt;/a&gt; and ability to write JOINs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep googling using keywords listed in each of these bullet points and read/watch till you understand these terms. Rest of it is really a matter of doing enough system design interviews, screwing them up and learning from where you went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A couple of good resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As is the case with any interview, the first step involves asking a lot of questions. I found it harder to come up with good questions in system design interviews as compared to coding interviews. A couple of approaches helped here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine told me to think of the system as a black box with inputs and outputs. Then a good way to figure out what questions to ask is to try and hammer down all the various inputs and outputs for the system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach that might work well is to mock out the front-end for which you are trying to build a backend system. And then trace the actions that you can take on the mock and verify with the interviewer if those actions are within the scope of what you are trying to achieve. Focus on minimizing the scope as much as possible. This is important to keep in mind because system design questions tend to be phrased very loosely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself struggling at these questions, it indicates that you probably haven’t worked on large scale complex systems and it may serve you well to factor that in when you pick your next job.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
